<!--
todo:
    -need refactor:
        -safe to assume that no squares should be revisted (i believe that would basically be the same as a shorter path with a little detour) i.e.: the shortest path will never repeat a square
        -need pass the pathLog to the possMoveFinder

    idea:
        - store all possible paths in array, the loop through for shortest
